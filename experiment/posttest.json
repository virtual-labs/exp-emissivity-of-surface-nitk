        "a": "The right answer is (d). A body with an emissivity of zero is often referred to as a perfect reflector or a white body.",
        "b": "The right answer is (d). A body with an emissivity of 0.5 is often referred to as a gray body. This means it absorbs and emits only half of the incident radiation compared to a perfect black body.",
        "c": "The right answer is (d). For example, certain types of brick and fiberglass have an emissivity around 0.753.",
        "d": "Correct, the right answer is (d). The emissivity of a perfect black body is 1."
