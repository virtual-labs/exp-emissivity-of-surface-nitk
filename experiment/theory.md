#### User Objectives and Goals:

1)To study properties of black body

2)To determine the emissivity of the test slab



#### Theory

When heat is supplied at a constant rate to a body, heat loss takes place by conduction, convection and radiation. If two bodies of the same geometry are heated under identical conditions as shown in Fig 1 and Fig 2, the heat loss by conduction and convection can be assumed to be same for both the bodies.

<br>The heat loss by radiation depends on:

Characteristic of the material<br>
Geometry of the surface<br>
Temperature of the surface<br>
Rate of heat loss to surrounding air by radiation is given by:<br>
Q=σA<sub>1</sub>(T<sub>1</sub> <sup>4</sup>-T<sub>2</sub> <sup>4</sup>)<br>
σ = Stefan-Boltzmann constant = -5.67×10<sup>-8</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup>K<sup>4</sup><br>
A<sub>1</sub> = surface area (m<sup>2</sup>)<br>
ϵ<sub>1</sub> = emissivity<br>
T<sub>1</sub> = surface temperature of the body (K)<br>
T<sub>2</sub> = surrounding atmospheric temperature (K)
